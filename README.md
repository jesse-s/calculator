# Jojawhi's Calculator assignment for The Odin Project

A simple JS calculator assignment.

## Learning Focus

The focus for this project was to get more practice with event listeners on buttons. This was a great opportunity to brush up on my math as well.

## Takeaway

My biggest takeaway from this project was the importance of planning out the logic before coding. 

I started by just experimenting and getting small things to work one at a time, but it got really messy and complicated very quickly. 

I ended up deciding to start over with JS, but I whiteboarded the whole thing first in pseudo-code. Once I was able to do that in a way that made sense to me, the coding part was easy, and the main functions worked first try.

## Future Additions

  - Convert to mobile application
  - History tracking
  - UI style redesign

## Known Bugs

- Long numbers overflow the display. Overflow handling styles need to be added.
